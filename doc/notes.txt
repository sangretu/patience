	Thinking it's a good idea to write up specs for key components. Off the top of my head, the JSON-AJAX template thing (really need to name this), Card, Zone, GameState, AppState, DataObject (serializable to JSON, no functions)?
	
	Hmm, the warrior Ajax of Agamemnon's army was known as the 'bulwark of the Mycenaeans'. How about Bulwark? I kinda like it. So if I define Bulwark v1.0, I have a spec for AJAX communications. Then if I define various data objects and give them appropriate names (assuming application namespace), that seems like the beginning of a communications API.
	
	Other elements of the program need to be better defined as well; there's currently a lot of bleed-over between components, which not only makes it hard to modify anything but also interferes with the ability to define each game type separately.
	
	Let's take a look at how it currently works. Key elements are:
	
	[Classes]
		Zone
		Card
	
	[Resources]
		Utility
		patience
	
	[Global variables]
		summit
		player
		game
		deck
		heart
		spade
		diamond
		club

	[Global functions]
		initPlayer
		initGame
		initMeasurements
		initZones
		initDeck
		initActions
	
	Some of this clearly needs to be reorganized; the suits, for example, should be separate to allow for non-standard card games; the init functions should probably go into an object; there's inconsistency in how resources and classes are used and defined; and many of the global variables might work best inside a GameState or AppState type object.
	
	Here's how the components interact right now:
	
		[Global variables]
			player is not used.
			game is instantiated as one of the game types within patience, and is used to reference zones, rules, css, and the start function.
			deck is referenced and modified within the start function, which is very bad, and appears to be instantiated within initDeck.
			suits are referenced within Card and initDeck (I feel like subclassing Card to PlayingCard might make sense for this).
		
		[Resources]
			patience is just used to instantiate game, using members as classes.
			Utility is a mix of general purpose functions and reference data, these should be split out.
		
		[Classes]
			Card is used everywhere.
			Zone is also used all over the place.
		
		[Global functions]
			initMeasurements is called automatically and actually modifies the Card class, seems messy.
			initPlayer doesn't actually do what it says, rather, creates the selection box and adds it to the page.
			initGame is triggered by the selection box, instantiates a game type, and calls the remaining init functions and the start function.
			initZones simply adds each zone in the game object to the page, can probably move this elsewhere.
			initDeck creates a standard deck of playing cards and shuffles them, probably can be moved somewhere too.
			initActions is tricky, defines in a general sense what the player can do, need to evaluate this further.

	How would I like the pieces to fit together? This might be better worked out on paper, but I'll try here for now.
	
	I'd like to limit global content to the main function and objects; no functions or variables, they should ideally all belong to something.
	
	A serializable GameState would be very useful in both saving / loading games and for potential server interactions (validation, remote storage, data collection, security checks).
	
	Similarly, player actions should be serializable, queued and processed locally for now but remotely later; this will require a data spec.
	
	I need to re-familiarize myself with JavaScript inheritance / subclassing and see how much of it is useful here, for data objects in particular.
	
	Still thinking about a standard element-object model, maybe with getElement in the object and either an object member of the element or a getObject function.
	
	The utility object is an interesting issue; some functions seem to belong in a separate general-purpose project, some are card game specific and need to be moved.
	
	Initialization stuff should be better defined and possibly split into other objects; it's unclear at this point whether the initial model of setting up dragging to and from each zone makes sense; keep in mind the complexity of not only rules evaluations but also jQuery UI's automatic checks.

	Was thinking today about organizing the infrastructure into "tiers", using inheritance to establish layers of complexity, like snapshots in a VM. So tier 1 might consist of Zone and Piece objects, and a later tier might have GameZone and GamePiece, then maybe CardZone and Card inherited from those. Perhaps by separating functionality into tiers this way, I can make the infrastructure more portable, allowing other applications to choose their own "branching off point", and reduce the custom code I'm dealing with at the application level.
	
	At an early tier, I'm going to need object<->element translation and an action queue. Not sure if that needs to include the main loop code or if that can wait until later. There are a lot of chicken-and-egg problems associated with animations and real-time user actions; states change in unexpected ways, and must be handled gracefully or things start getting buggy and ugly.
	
	Looking at the object<->element translation first...
	
	I recently discovered that it was possible to attach objects directly to elements, which removes the need for a lookup feature between the two. Depending on how I use it though, it might necessitate some cleanup code for when an object/element pair is destroyed, to prevent memory leaks.
	
	At any rate, my most recent attempt on this was to set <object>.element = <element> and then <object>.element.object = <object> within <object>.getElement(), which is effectively when the element is initially created. I'm not convinced the naming convention is ideal, but the approach seems reasonable.
	
	Another feature I had in that method was the inclusion of arbitrary CSS on a specific element. While this seems useful, I'm not sure if the current approach (providing it as a constructor argument) is the best way to go about it. Also, when would it be necessary to set CSS in the code rather than in the CSS file? I suppose if you were trying to be dynamic...almost analog? I should see how I'm currently using it. Ah, I see. It was based on a previous design where I was trying to dynamically load each game type and using the main program exclusively as the engine; the model failed because I couldn't include functions in JSON files, although I may revisit it later. Anyway, the feature isn't necessary, although it is potentially useful. Actually, it might make it easier to keep things organized, rather than having a separate css file for each game type and having to worry about possibly de-registering styles when changing game types. I think I'll keep it.
	
	Now, both Zone and Piece will need the full getElement() feature, so it makes sense to have a parent object for them. What would that be? Do they have anything else in common? ID, although I need to turn that into UID or GUID. I could try merging the parent object with my previous concept of a Component.

	Did some refactoring of my inheritance model, I'll skip the details here. Created new Zone and Piece classes that inherit from Component, now what features do they have? We're not at the Card stage yet, but certainly moving pieces between zones can be handled at this tier, right? And at what point will I need the action queue?
	
	Ok, I've got gainPiece/losePiece working, but saving animation, chaining, side effects etc for a later tier or implementation.
